External Libraries
==================

TODO (much more detail, and author/licence info)

None of this would be even remotely possible without the amazing open source
community, and the following fantastic libraries that I've been able to use:

Flask
-----

Python (Micro) web framework

Peewee
------

Simple, splendid Python ORM

Flask-Peewee
~~~~~~~~~

Joining flask and peewee together with ease

Sqlite
------

Simple, Fast single-file database system.

jQuery
------

Better DOM for javascript in the browser

Also these jQuery plugins:

jQuery.anytime
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Converting dates and times nicely

jQuery.timePicker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Seriously, why haven't browsers got this stuff built in? Oh well, this makes it
easy!

chosen
~~~~~~

Very sweet multiselect boxes.

knockout.js
-----------

For doing interactive object modelling and user-interface stuff which would
be horrible in javascript + html otherwise.

knockout.mapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Which turns non-schema/undefined messy JSON objects into knockout object arrays
which can be assigned, modified, and played with.

Twitter Bootstrap
-----------------

I'm not a front-end CSS wizard, and this helps the admin interface look clean and
professional with so little work from me.  It really does wonders.

Pylint
------

For making it so much easier to keep the code base consistent and clean.

pylint git commit hook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

forcing me to keep it clean.

Bleach
------

Stripping and cleaning HTML is so easy with this great library!

FeedParser
----------

Parsing XML (RSS & Atom) feeds has never been so easy!

Passlib & py-bcrypt
-------------------

There is no reason to keep passwords insecurely...

Waitress
--------

The simplest WSGI server ever...
