# In progress

- Screen info updating.

# Missing basic Features

## Urgent:

- Font for screen zones (easy)

## Would be nice:

- Post deactivation -> archive, and archive, future posts, etc view.
- WYSIWYG editor for HTML posts.
- Group Editor, etc.
- Better uploaded files editor.

# Good things for the future:

- New name
- Documentation
- Icons
- clean up CSS. possibly with LESS or similar?
- Unit tests
- replace db.py & run.py with a single manage.py type script
- Internationalisation / multilingual stuff.
- basic password strength checking
- login attempts counting/stopping
- Better client & serverside validation.

# Random ideas:

- Feed type options:
  - Locally fed (as normal)
  - From RSS feed
  - From twitter?
  etc
  (rather than weird 'RSS' post type a la concerto)
